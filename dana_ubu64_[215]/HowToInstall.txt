Dana requires the following steps:

1. Set an environment variable DANA_HOME to point at the directory containing dnc, dana, dnl etc.

2. Add DANA_HOME to your system's executable search path.

On Linux you'll also need to do chmod +x dana dnc from a terminal window in the DANA_HOME directory.

You can set environment variables on most Linux distributions by opening ~/.bashrc and adding to the end:

export DANA_HOME=/home/where/you/put/dana/
PATH=$PATH:$DANA_HOME

Then save the file, log out and log in again.

To test your installation, open a command prompt anywhere and issue the command: dana esher

You should be presented with the evolution shell runtime command-prompt.

Please note that the GUI subsystem is not currently deployed for Linux so GUI-based examples will not work.
